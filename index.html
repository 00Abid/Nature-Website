        Nature, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural world,
        physical world, or material world. "Nature" refers to the phenomena of
        the physical world, and also to life in general. It ranges in scale from
        the subatomic to the cosmic. The term "nature" may refer to living
        plants and animals, geological processes, weather, and physics, such as
        matter and energy. The term is often refers to the "natural environment"
        or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general areas
        that have not been substantially altered by humans, or which persist
        despite human intervention. For, example, manufactured objects and human
        interaction are generally not considered part of nature, unless
        qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This
        more traditional concept of "nature" implies a distinction between
        natural and artificial elements of the Earth, with the artificial as
        that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a
        human mind.The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or
        "essential qualities, innate disposition", and literally means
        "birth".[1] Natura was a Latin translation of the Greek word physis
        (φύσις), which correlated plants, animals, and other features of the
        world as developing of their own accord.[2][3] The concept of nature as
        a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the
        original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word
        φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers, and has steadily gained currency
        ever since.

        By discovering nature, you discover yourself.” – Maxime Lagacé, A
        beautifully penned sentence. Nature is the entire physical world around
        us in a broad sense. It includes atmosphere, weather, ecosystem, flora,
        fauna, and landscapes. The beautiful environment around us who we call
        nature is the mother of all humans. It nurtures and nourishes us. It
        provides us with all the necessities to survive. Right from the food we
        eat, the air we breathe, the clothes we wear, and the houses we live in
        are the gift of nature. God has only gifted earth with nature, and we
        should be thankful for that.living here. Nature is also called a human
        attribute in behavioral terminology. The natural environment which is in
        physical form is called nature. Forests, Water reservoirs, mountains,
        Deserts all together called nature. Nature exists before the origin of
        humankind on earth. It has encountered various changes for the
        development of an entity of humankind. Nature is nurturing all living
        organisms for years. Sadly, humans are not recognizing the giver
        attribute of nature.

        Nature can be defined as the physical world and the life which interacts
        with it. It is the total of the ecosystem, animals, birds, plants,
        landscapes, and humans. Nature not just includes the life but also is
        the host for the non-living physical entities as well. Nature took
        billions of years to grow and form to shape what we see today. Nature
        has given us everything. The sweet sound of chirping birds to hear every
        morning, crystal clear water to drink every day, a cold breeze to feel,
        pure air to breathe in, and mouth-watering food to eat is entirely
        pleasing. Mother Nature has always nourished us. It has always taken
        care of us and has provided us with all the necessities of life. During
        the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries,
        nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine
        laws.[5][6] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became
        seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it
        was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American
        transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human
        history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to
        the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after
        Charles Darwin.[
